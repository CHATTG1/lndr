## TODO

- logging
- better error handling
    + validate all input data
- configuration file to eliminate hard-coded values
- friends lists

- between tx submission to blockchain & inclusion in a block,
  users can create a pending tx that will never be deleted
    + this logic will change soon, so don't worry about this now,
      though similar problems will present themselves in the future
